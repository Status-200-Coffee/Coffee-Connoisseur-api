# Coffee Connoisseur API
## Project Summary
Welcome to the Coffee Connoisseur API! This API serves as the backend for the Coffee Connoisseur app, an application that allows users to search for coffee shops near them on a map, collect beans as a reward system when they post pictures of the coffee they purchase from the coffee shops. If you're interested in the app itself, you can find it on GitHub.
