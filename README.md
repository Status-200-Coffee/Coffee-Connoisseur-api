# Coffee Connoisseur API ‚òïÔ∏è
## Project Summary

Welcome to the Coffee Connoisseur API!üëã 
This API serves as the backend for the Coffee Connoisseur app, an application that allows users to search for coffee shops near them on a map, collect beans as a reward system when they post pictures of the coffee they purchase from the coffee shops. 
If you're interested in the app itself, you can find it on GitHub : https://github.com/Status-200-Coffee/Coffee-Connoisseur-app 

## Introduction

This API is built using Node.js, Koa.js, and MongoDB. It provides endpoints for retrieving coffee shop data, user profiles, and reward systems. 

## API Base URL

You can access the API at: https://coffee-connoisseur-api.onrender.com/api

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
* You have installed the latest version of Node.js and MongoDB.
* You have a MongoDB Atlas account.

## MongoDB Atlas Setup

Before you can use the Coffee Connoisseur API, you need to set up a MongoDB Atlas account and create a database cluster. Follow these steps:

1. Sign up for a [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register) account if you don't have one.
2. Once you're logged in, create a new project.
3. Within the new project, build a new cluster.
4. After the cluster is created, click on "CONNECT" button.
5. Add your current IP address to the IP Whitelist and create a MongoDB user with a username and password.
6. Choose "Connect your application".
7. Copy the connection string and replace `<username>` and `<password>` with the MongoDB user you created in step 5.

You will use this connection string in the `.env` file in the "Setup" section.

## Setup

To use the Coffee Connoisseur API, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
``` 
$ git clone https://github.com/Status-200-Coffee/Coffee-Connoisseur-api.git`
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
$ cd Coffee-Connoisseur-api
```

3. Install the necessary dependencies by running the command `npm install`:
```
$ npm install
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add this to the `.gitignore` file

5. Inside the `.env` file, add the following line:

    ```
    URI=<Your MongoDB Atlas Connection String>
    ```

    Replace `<Your MongoDB Atlas Connection String>` with your actual MongoDB Atlas connection string. It should look something like this:

    ```
    URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
    ```

    Make sure to replace `<username>`, `<password>`, and `<dbname>` with your MongoDB Atlas username, password, and database name respectively.

6. Save the `.env` file and proceed with the rest of the instructions.

## Seeding the databases:

Run the following scripts to seed the MongoDB Atlas databases:

* To **seed** the development database:

```
$ npm run seed-dev
```

* To **seed** the test database:

```
$ npm run test
```

## Running the tests:

Run all Jest test suites using the following script:

```
$ npm run test
```

## Connecting the app to your local host:

Run the server locally using the following command and follow the link to http://localhost:9090 

```
$ npm run start
```
You should see the following string in the console:
`"Server running on http://localhost:9090"`
